Web Conference 2014

Managing the Environment: Development to Production with Vagrant and Version Control

Maintaining a development environment that is as close to production as possible is an important step towards avoiding unexpected issues that arise when publishing code. By starting a project with its environment, using that environment in development, and keeping that environment under version control, we can better ensure the stability of projects in production. In this session we’ll walk through the basics of Vagrant and the joy of developing locally in a virtual machine that matches production. We’ll also cover how to manage this environment as part of a larger version control strategy. Throughout the session, real world examples of successes and failures will be shown using the open source platform built around WordPress at Washington State University.

SLIDE - “The Future Friendly Web”

The tagline on this year’s Web Conference is “The Future Friendly Web”.

SLIDE - Venn diagram, developers at the center, designers, managers, content creators all creating overlaps.

Who is everyone - hand raising?

SLIDE - Maybe zoom out, show this venn diagram as part of the greater web.

We’re all here as part of the greater web community, interested in finding, creating, and playing the roles necessary to creating and maintaining a future friendly web. This specific talk on managing the development environment is targeted at developers want to explore ways to expand workflow, though the methods and lessons within can be helpful when applied anywhere.

SLIDE - A future friendly web is one that can change when you want it to.

Our challenge in creating a future friendly web is creating a web that can change when you want it to. MORE

SLIDE - 

To achieve our goal of a future friendly web that is able to change when we want or need it to, we can look to rapid and incremental improvements.

Nobody has a chance to prevent change because everything is already constantly changing.

This does seem like a lofty goal. There are often enough University or other client politics in the way that make rapid, constant change a difficult thing to approach. Once that line is crossed, however, I think the benefits are …

So what does this entail.

Version control.
Provisioning, version controlled.
Deployment, version controlled.
Trust in yourself. Trust in your coworkers. Trust in your clients.

SLIDE - Version Control

Version control is likely the most important step to rapid and incremental improvements. It provides a base for provisioning, deployment, and trust by giving you the ability to move back and forth along the timeline of a project’s existence.
